The blade shines a dull blueish-white when drawn, providing not enough light
to see by, yet just enough to be seen.  The short blade is only a few inches
long, yet is very sharp, and along the edges a flickering blue halo can
occasionally be seen.  Etched runes litter the surface of the blade, holding
the obviously magical enchantment inside.  The blade itself dulls with
difficulty on a nearby rock, but quickly reforms into a perfectly honed
edge, just like a well enchanted weapon should.

This strange animal resembles a large, mutated albino wolf. Upon closer
observation, its five-fingered paws appear ominously humanlike, and an
intelligence far beyond that of mere animals gleams in its bloodshot pink
eyes. The creature looks you over curiously, then holds up a golden medallion
for you to see, the symbol of the undead count Tarrant etched into its
surface.

Keywords are:  'alignment goal'
Format:
alignment goal <desired alignment>
Alignment is a measure of how good or evil you are.  You can become good by
killing evil things, or become evil by killing good things - but you must
set a goal first.  If you don't set an alignment goal, you will stay
neutral, which is probably a good thing for new players to be anyway.  You
can decide on and change your alignment goal at any time.
You can use the 'alignment' command with no arguments to see your current
alignment, and your current alignment goal.  
The advantages of alignment are that some things may or may not attack you
if you are a particular alignment, and certain spells can have different
effects if you are good or evil.  Additionally, some equipment can only be
worn if you are of a specific alignment.
Before setting your alignment goal, keep in mind that it may take a -very-
long time to reach certain goals.  If there is a preponderance of evil
players in the game, it can be very hard to also become evil.  It may
however, be very easy to become good.

enough for the target to look around and scan the area.  As a side effect,
nearby creatures may be attracted to the light, and those in the immediate
area may be temporarily blinded.

The animal is odd, but obviously adapted to the desert.  Its skin is
dry, and the back half of it looks similar to a horse.  The neck and
chest area are fur covered, and it has a mane like that of a lion.  The
head protrudes from the mane and looks like a badger, but the widely
gaping jaws and lack of teeth make it obvious that it is much more. The
jaw is lined with a single sharp ridge on the top and the bottom,
making for a powerful looking scissor-like mouth.  It moves mostly in
straight lines, it doesn't seem to like altering its course, and when
it does it is a slow and ponderous affair.  The leucrotta doesn't seem
to be able to bend its spine.

You reply to Dentin, nod
You reply to Dentin, trying to find the right calculation, i kinda suck at math
You reply to Dentin, :P
You tell Kliro, say u have 500 mana max
You tell Kliro, and u regen 80
Dentin replies, the value isnt fixed though, are you going to keep a running average of the differential?  it might be easiest to just assume that 'show regen' is in chunks of 30 seconds
You reply to Dentin, nod
You reply to Dentin, im doing that
Kliro replies, yeah?
Dentin replies, ok
You tell Dentin, im just grabbing the show regen value
You tell Dentin, and thats the actual regen
You tell Dentin, now just trying to figure otu how i can convert this to signle seconds, hrm think I got it
Kliro replies, about seven tics
Dentin replies, nod, I think if you grab that and divide by 3, then check in ten second chunks that should do it
Kliro replies, eight to get completely full
You tell Kliro, Dentin replies, nod, I think if you grab that and divide by 3, then check in ten seconds chunks that should do it

You reply to Kliro, nod
Kliro replies, and to do that in ten second chunks
Kliro replies, would b about
Kliro replies, about 2 tics a sec
You reply to Kliro, what
You reply to Kliro, um
Kliro replies, u said divide 80 by three then make that into 10 second chunks
You reply to Kliro, nod
You will require 16 seconds to regen mana.
Kliro replies, well thats what i did
You will require 480 seconds to regen mana.
Kliro replies, divided 80 by three
Kliro replies, which is about 21
You will require 13.333333333333 seconds to regen mana.
You reply to Kliro, but how can i do it man
You reply to Kliro, ugh
Kliro replies, then figured how many mamana points it would take a sec to make 21
You reply to Kliro, kk my mush grabs the actual value, maximum value and the regen
You reply to Kliro, like
You reply to Kliro, hp=100,max=500,regen=50
You reply to Kliro, example
You reply to Kliro, and thats 50 per tick
Kliro replies, kay
You reply to Kliro, then my mush used to go like
You reply to Kliro, Note("You will require " .. mregtime .. " tick to regen mana.")
You reply to Kliro, uh
(friend) Dagget has entered the game.
You reply to Kliro, the regentime formula is
You reply to Kliro, mregentime = (maxmn-currentmn)/(mregen)
(friend) Stewie has left the game.
Kliro replies, hmm
You tell Dentin, cuz now it says how many ticks you need
You tell Dentin, like
You tell Dentin, You will require 1 tick to regen mana.

You reply to Dentin, nod I'll run a few tsts on it
You reply to Dentin, is it actually goign to be enforced?

You tell Kliro, Dentin replies, nod, I think if you grab that and divide by 3, then check in ten seconds chunks that should do it 
Kliro replies, i think what its doing is taking how much u regen and then just seing how many tics it would take and then applying that
Kliro replies, by seeing how much you should regen every 30 seconds
You reply to Kliro, nod its what i do
You reply to Kliro, those are mys cripts
You reply to Kliro, its what its doing right now
Kliro replies, so the simple answer to this new regen thing
You reply to Kliro, but that no longer works
You reply to Kliro, what the fuck are 10 second chunks
Kliro replies, shrugs
Kliro replies, to me this is what i would do
Kliro replies, i would take the regen and divide it by 30 to see how much you would get in a normal tic and then how much u would get per second
You reply to Kliro, k
Kliro replies, then take the per second and act as if its a normal tif
Kliro replies, tic
You reply to Kliro, nod
Kliro replies, therefore increasing the amount of tics needed to regen but also making it faster
You will require -1333.3333333333 seconds to regen mana.
Kliro replies, see my logic?
You reply to Kliro, that doesnt really work
You reply to Kliro, heh

[950] ---- Jan 30, 10
Level calculation changes for taunt, roar, and intimidate.  This will
probably require rebalancing of the experience levels for these skills,
which may take some time.
You can no longer fill spellcasting liquids from infinite springs.
The chance of escape from entangling roots has been changed.
The 'dice' command is no longer emote spoofable.
Add 'show report'.
From Locane:
Improve offline ignore against spammer flagged players.
Color added to noleave and defend toggle strings.
Improve parsing of spell names when groupcasting.
You can now use second wind while healing someone.
Healing touch with no target will now target yourself by default.
New string added to bash skill when target is knocked down.
Allow insulting of worn items by wear location.
Allow 'list search' in shops, similar to 'locker search' (llist).
Bound players can no longer be group summoned.
An option for event based regen, 'set regen', has been added as an
experiment.  This breaks regen up across the entire tick, instead of
just on tick boundaries.  Once set, you can only clear it by relogging.
Experimental changes to clan rosters to try to improve lists and clan
management have been installed.  These may or may not cause problems,
prepare for a bumpy ride.
[947] ---- Jan 26, 10
Don't display broken skills (hunting/tailoring/etc) on slist.
Gaze will no longer target clan rooms.
Consistency fixes to waypoints and recall sites.
Fix weirdness with graphs of room temperature.
Taunt exp for large numbers of mobs at once lowered.
From Locane:
Widen allowed range of luck and absorb stats.
Disable the 'you are fully healed' send for the 'haven' spell.
[944] ---- Jan 16, 10
The http area list can now take creator names as an option, to list areas
per creator.  For example, http://alteraeon.com:8080/areas/dentin
[940] ---- Jan 13, 10
From Locane:
Minor bugfixes to 'list' functionality.
Pk/ignore fixes to warrior skills.
[938] ---- Jan 11, 10
Major changes to low level exp and exp caps.  These changes affect only
total 59 and below.  60 total and higher are not affected at all.
The leveling table has been globally updated to use a calculated function
instead of manually set values.  In general, level costs should be within
a few percent of where they were before.
From Locane:
Minor fix to clan channel replay.
Make autodoor toggleable via 'autodoor' command.
Other autodoor display fixes.
Most recent 5 entries displayed.
